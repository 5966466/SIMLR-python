## Using Instruction
Before running demo.py, please ensure that your Python is version 3.7.1, and NumPy v1.15.4, scipy v1.1.0, scikit-learn v0.20.1, or these codes may not work well.

If you first run these codes, please enter src directory and run setup.py using command
`python setup.py build`
Then run copies.py
`python copies.py`
*This procedure helps compile all the C/C++ files.*

All the data sets are saved in .pkl files which is convenient to use in python. Their original data are saved in .csv files.
